Nice to meet you. 

I am currently a postdoc at the [Chair of Psychological Methods and Diagnostics at LMU Munich](https://www.psy.lmu.de/pm/personen/lehrstuhlmitarbeiter/zygar/index.html).

My research focuses on motivational processes in couple relationships and methodological approaches to study everyday life (Experience Sampling, Ecological Momentary Interventions; [find out more in my publications](https://psycaroly.github.io/publications/)).

I'm a passionate coder in the statistical programming language R 👩‍💻, and a boardgame geek 🎲.

Open Science is the future. In my work I am committed to [research transparency](http://www.researchtransparency.org) <img src="http://www.researchtransparency.org/media/rt_logo_very_small.png" width="30" height="30">.

I orient my actions according to the values of openness, mutual respect and gratitude.

My ❤️ belongs to my wonderful husband and my brilliant little son.

Current projects
======

I am currently on parental leave. 

In summer 2023 I am starting a [project funded by the German Research Foundation](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/497443642?language=en) which aims to causally investigate fundamental assumptions of motivational theories applied to couple relationships. I will be recruiting a PhD student for this project soon. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/psycaroly) for updates.
