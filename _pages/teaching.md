I enjoy teaching and sharing my expertise with others as part of my job as a research fellow. I am experienced in conducting workshops on various topics that I have specialized in (see below for an overview of past workshops), and I find it rewarding to help others learn and grow in their knowledge.
If you would like to discuss the possibility of me leading a session for your group, feel free to contact me.

Additionally, I am happy to announce that my colleagues and I share our teaching materials as open educational resources for anyone to use (CC-BY-SA). We believe that knowledge should be accessible to all, and we hope that our resources will be useful to educators and students alike. You can find our (mostly German) materials here: <a href="https://osf.io/c59hv/">https://osf.io/c59hv/</a>.

Many of my (and other people's) workshop materials are available on the repository of the Open Science in Psychology Initiative at LMU: <a href="https://osf.io/mgwk8/">https://osf.io/mgwk8/</a>

Here's an overview of my teaching and workshop history:
