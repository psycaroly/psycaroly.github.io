text <- " Relationship satisfaction can be assessed in retrospection, as a global evaluation, or as a momentary state. In two experience sampling studies (N = 130, N = 510) the specificities of these assessment modalities are examined. We show that 1) compared to other summary statistics like the median, the mean of relationship satisfaction states describes retrospective and global evaluations best (but the difference to some other summary statistics was negligible); 2) retrospection introduces an overestimation of the average annoyance in the relationship reported on a momentary basis, which results in an overall negative mean-level bias for retrospective relationship satisfaction; 3) this bias is most strongly moderated by global relationship satisfaction at the time of retrospection; 4) snapshots of momentary relationship satisfaction get representative of global evaluations after approximately two weeks of sampling. The findings extend the recall bias reported in the literature for retrospection of negative affect to the domain of relationship evaluations and assist researchers in designing efficient experience sampling studies. Motivational variables are considered fundamental factors influencing the occurrence of behavior.
The current study compared different types of motivational variables (implicit and explicit motive
dispositions, motivation as states and as aggregated person-level variables) in their ability to
predict communal and agentic behavior reports in intimate relationships. 510 individuals
completed measures of dispositional communion and agency motives and participated in a dyadic
experience sampling study with five assessments per day across four weeks. They reported on their
momentary communal and agentic motivation, as well as on their own and their partner's
behaviors. All examined types of motivational variables predicted certain behavior reports on the
between-person or within-person level and had incremental effects beyond the other motivational
variables in at least one motive domain. Directly replicating and conceptually extending prior
research, the effects of motivational states and their aggregates were consistently found across
behavioral outcomes, across self- and partner-reports and across the motive domains of
communion and agency. Using the example of motivational states, the general value of assessing
within-person variables for psychological phenomena in ESM designs is discussed. Relationship closeness is considered an important psychological variable for studying couple relationships, and is often postulated as cause for important relationship outcomes. The current study evaluates four micro-interventions for their suitability to experimentally elicit feelings of closeness towards one's partner. Using participants' smartphones, and a combination of experience sampling, event sampling, and ecological momentary interventions, individuals reported for a week on their experiences of closeness before and after completing daily either a neutral task or a task meant to enhance relationship closeness. The closeness tasks included showing physical affection, sharing a childhood memory, looking each other in the eyes for five minutes, and discussing shared life achievements. Results of intention-to-treat analyses on a within-person level showed that closeness increased from pre- to post-measurement on average more strongly on days of any of the four examined closeness conditions than on days of the neutral control conditions. Interindividual variability of this effect was observed, emphasizing the relevance of using within-person designs to evaluate such interventions. Exploratory analyses showed that effect sizes declined across time within the day. This study provides instruments for research on causal effects of closeness in everyday relationship life, and an evidence basis for smartphone-delivered interventions in practitioner settings. Most people consider a satisfying couple relationship an important goal in their
life. Past research reveals that relationship satisfaction is a multi-determined
phenomenon which is related to various desirable outcomes. It differs as a global,
generalized relationship evaluation between individuals, but also on a momentary
basis as a state between situations for a single individual. This dissertation investigates
motivational processes that precede the experience of momentary instances
of relationship satisfaction and illustrates how such state relationship evaluations
relate to global and retrospective relationship satisfaction. Thereby, this research
examines and demonstrates the added value of assessing states beyond more traditional
measures in psychology for the study of couple relationships. Two studies
applying the Experience Sampling Method were conducted, in which both members
of a committed, heterosexual relationship reported on their motivational,
behavioral, affective and satisfaction states five times a day for two and four
weeks. Additionally, person and relationship characteristics as well as retrospective
reports on the study period were obtained. The data of these studies was
analyzed in three papers that constitute the central content of this dissertation.
The results shed light on the behaviors, functioning and evaluations in couple relationship
through the investigation of states and processes in individuals' everyday
lives.
The papers are introduced by an overview of the covered topics, and by a description
on how the presented research follows from general approaches to explain
relationship satisfaction with interpersonal processes and between-person differences.
It is elaborated how challenges in the field are tackled with the employed
dyadic experience sampling study design and how this relates to the presented papers.
Paper 1 focuses on the description and empirical examination of a motivational
process model, which is proposed as potential explanation for how individual's
motive dispositions influence their global relationship satisfaction. The results
provide evidence for the model in the domain of communion motives.
Paper 2 scrutinizes one part of the process model by conducting a direct replication,
and many conceptual replications of the association between motivational
states and behavior, revealing strong supporting evidence for this within-person
effect. For the prediction of behavior levels between persons, this paper additionally
compares the predictive value of aggregated motivational states, explicit and
implicit motives. The results demonstrate the relevance of assessing motivational
states not only for within-person analyses, but also for between-person analyses
of behavior occurring in couple relationships.
Paper 3 focuses on relationship satisfaction as an important outcome variable
for the current research and for a large body of relationship research in general.
Aggregated state assessments of relationship satisfaction are compared with retrospective
and global assessments. The results indicate that the average state
relationship satisfaction is related to global relationship satisfaction, but that in
retrospection a negative mean-level bias emerges. Different relationship and person
characteristics are identified as moderators of this bias.
Finally, the goals and findings from the presented papers are summarized in a
holistic discussion. Some general limitations of this dissertation are illustrated:
reactivity and fatigue as methodological side effects of the Experience Sampling
Method, constraints on the generalizability of the findings, and preliminary results
on the non-replicability of some of the presented effects. The contributions
of this dissertation for motivational psychology, relationship research, psychological
methods and practical settings are highlighted, along with a discussion of
implications for future research.
Adhering to open science principles, the current work provides two large dyadic
experience sampling data sets – both published as scientific use-files – as well as
transparent, reproducible, partly preregistered analyses on important topics in
several psychological research domains. Embedded in a theoretically founded process model (termed Dynamics of Motive Satisfaction, 'DynaMoS'), the present study examined the links between the implicit dispositional communion motive, everyday motivational
dynamics, and relationship outcomes in couples. Within-subject processes are proposed to explain betweensubject
associations of dispositional motives and relationship satisfaction. For an empirical test of the model, data
on the dispositional partner-related need for communion and global relationship satisfaction were obtained from
152 individuals in heterosexual relationships. In an extensive experience sampling spanning 2 weeks, a subsample
of 130 individuals answered questions about their current motivational states, mood, state relationship satisfaction,
and experiences with their partner five times a day. The results were largely consistent with the DynaMoS model:
(1) individuals with a strong dispositional implicit communion motive reported more often to be in a communal motivational
state; (2) communally motivated individuals were more likely to engage in subsequent instrumental behaviour;
and (3) relationship experiences that potentially satisfy communion motivation led to more positive relationship
outcomes when individuals were motivated before compared with when they were not. It is discussed how these results
and the experience sampling method can foster our understanding of how dispositional characteristics translate into
everyday processes and shape relationship outcomes. The investigation of within-person process models, often done in experience sampling designs, requires a reliable assessment
of within-person change. In this paper, we focus on dyadic intensive longitudinal designs where both partners of a couple
are assessed multiple times each day across several days. We introduce a statistical model for variance decomposition
based on generalizability theory, which can estimate the relative proportion
of variability on four hierarchical levels: moments within a day, days, persons, and couples. Based on these variance
estimates, four reliability coefficients are derived: between-couples, between-persons, within-persons between-days, and
within-persons between-moments. We apply the model to two dyadic intensive experience sampling studies (n1 = 130
persons, 5 surveys each day for 14 days, ≥7508 unique surveys; n2 = 508 persons, 5 surveys each day for 28 days, ≥47764
unique surveys). Five different scales in the domain of motivational processes and relationship quality were assessed with 2
to 5 items: State relationship satisfaction, communal motivation, and agentic motivation; the latter consists of two subscales,
namely power and independence motivation. Largest variance components were on the level of persons, moments, couples,
and days, where within-day variance was generally larger than between-day variance. Reliabilities ranged from .32 to .76
(couple level), .93 to .98 (person level), .61 to .88 (day level), and .28 to .72 (moment level). Scale intercorrelations reveal
differential structures between and within persons, which has consequences for theory building and statistical modeling. Although rooted in reality, partner perceptions often reflect wishful thinking due to perceivers' needs.
Dispositional needs, or motives, can differ between persons; however, little is known about their differential associations
with everyday partner perception. The present study used data from a 4-week experience sampling study (N = up
to 60942 surveys from 510 individuals nested in 259 couples) to examine the effects of perceivers' partner-related
implicit and explicit communal motives on the perception of (i) global communal partner behaviour and (ii) specific
communal and uncommunal partner behaviours. The results of truth and bias models of judgement and quasi-signal
detection analyses indicate that strong implicit communal approach motives and strong explicit communal motives
are associated with the tendency to overestimate the partner's communal behaviour. Additionally, strong implicit communal
approach motives were associated with the tendency to avoid perceptions of uncommunal partner behaviour.
Neither implicit nor explicit communal motives had an effect on accuracy in the perception of particularly communal
partner behaviour. The results highlight the relevance of both implicit and explicit communal motives for momentary
partner perceptions and emphasise the benefits of dyadic microlongitudinal designs for a better understanding of the
mechanisms through which individual differences manifest in couples' everyday lives. Can romantic partners accurately perceive each other's communal motives, or are these perceptions
biased by their own motivational hopes and fears? This study used data from N = 1,905 partnered participants
to examine the extent to which partner perceptions of communal motives correspond to targets'
(accuracy) and perceivers' (motivational bias) explicit and implicit communal motives. Our results indicate
that explicit communal motives and implicit communal approach motives can be (a) accurately
inferred and (b) positively bias communal motive perception. Furthermore, there was no evidence for
moderation of either accuracy or motivational bias by relationship length. These findings point to the
early visibility of both implicit and explicit motives in couples, as well as their persistent biasing effects
on partner perception. This article presents an integrative conceptual model of motivational interdependence
in couples, the MIC model. Based on theoretical tenets in motivation psychology,
personality psychology, and research on interpersonal perception, the MIC model
postulates that two partners' motive dispositions fundamentally interact in shaping their
individual motivation and behavior. On a functional level, a partner's motivated behavior
is conceptualized as an environmental cue that can contribute to an actor's motive
expression and satisfaction. However, the partner's motivated behavior is considered
to gain this motivational relevance only via the actor's subjective perception. Multilevel
analyses of an extensive experience sampling study on partner-related communal
motivation (N = up to 60,803 surveys from 508 individuals nested in 258 couples)
supported the MIC model. Participants, particularly those with strong communal motive
dispositions, behaved more communally at moments when they perceived their partners
to behave more communally. In addition, participants experienced momentary boosts
in satisfaction when they behaved more communally and, at the same time, perceived
their partners' behavior as similarly communal. Broader implications of the MIC model
for research on romantic relationships are discussed.  We present two openly accessible databases related to the assessment of implicit motives using
Picture Story Exercises (PSEs): (a) A database of 183,415 German sentences, nested in 26,389
stories provided by 4,570 participants, which have been coded by experts using Winter's coding
system for the implicit affiliation intimacy, achievement, and power motives, and (b) a database of
54 classic and new pictures which have been used as PSE stimuli. Updated picture norms are provided
which can be used to select appropriate pictures for PSE applications. Based on an analysis
of the relations between raw motive scores, word count, and sentence count, we give recommendations
on how to control motive scores for story length, and validate the recommendation with
a meta-analysis on gender differences in the implicit affiliation motive that replicates existing findings.
We discuss to what extent the guiding principles of the story length correction can be generalized
to other content coding systems for narrative material. Several potential applications of the
databases are discussed, including (un)supervised machine learning of text content, psychometrics,
and better reproducibility of PSE research. Recalling Experiences Looking at Momentary, Retrospective and Global Assessments of Relationship Satisfaction Motivated Behavior in Intimate Relationships:
